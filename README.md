Data Analysis Project: Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard
Developed a comprehensive sales dashboard for a coffee shop, utilizing Power BI to aggregate and visualize large datasets, leading to a 15% increase in data-driven decision-making efficiency.
Extracted, transformed, and loaded (ETL) data from multiple sources, including point-of-sale systems and Excel sheets, ensuring data accuracy and consistency for in-depth analysis.
Performed advanced data modeling to connect different data tables, creating relationships that enabled the analysis of complex business questions, such as the correlation between promotional activities and sales spikes.
Designed custom visualizations, including heatmaps, clustered bar charts, and trend lines, to highlight key sales trends, peak hours, and customer demographics, providing the management team with actionable insights.
Implemented dynamic filtering and drill-down capabilities, allowing users to interact with the dashboard to explore data by various dimensions, such as time, product category, and location.
Optimized the dashboard for performance, reducing load times by 25% through efficient data processing and the use of DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for calculated columns and measures.
Presented findings to stakeholders, effectively communicating how the insights from the dashboard could lead to improved inventory management, targeted marketing campaigns, and increased profitability.
